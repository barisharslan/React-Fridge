# React Fridge Project

This project will be a little app I use to track various fridge and kitchen related activities in my own kitchen. This is the first larger scale project that I am attempting with my Raspberry Pi. It's core functionality will be to track food that we currently have inside the fridge. We will hopefully, either directly, or through an app, be able to enter things into the fridge, and take them out. There are several side functionalities I would like to include as well:
+ Keep track of common foods and their common expiration times
+ Use above info to notify user on foods that are going to go bad soon, etc
+ There are more that I can't think of right now
